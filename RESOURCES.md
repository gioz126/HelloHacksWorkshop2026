```

## #13 Ask AI to make the buttons do something

Copy and paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```text
Make clicking a button display the type clicked as simple text.
```

---

## #14 Set up the code for later

### Update the button

Within the button, update the `onClick` to look like this:

```jsx
onClick={() => handleTypeClick(type.name)}
```

### Add these functions

At the top of your component, before `return` and underneath the state:

```jsx
function getMatchup(type) {
  // API CALL WILL GO HERE, AND WE WILL RETURN THE RESPONSE
  return `Fake API response: You are fighting a ${type}-type Pokémon.`;
}

function handleTypeClick(type) {
  const response = getMatchup(type);
  setResult(response);
}
```

## #15 Set up the backend

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

---

## #16 Ask AI to set up a template backend

Copy and paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```text
Set up template code for a simple GET endpoint.
```

---

## #17 Test the route

To run our backend, within the backend folder run:

```bash
npx nodemon server.js
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

Your URL will likely have something added to the end.

---

## #18 Update our GET endpoint to call the API

Copy and paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```text
Update our GET endpoint to call this API and return the response:

GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/{id or name}/
```

---

## #19 Ask AI to simplify the response

Copy and paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```text
Update the response of our GET endpoint to only contain this data from the Poke API:

half_damage_to
double_damage_from

Only return the names.
```

---

## #20 Ask AI to connect our frontend to our backend

Copy and paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```text
Update getMatchup to call our route and return the response with a try catch.

http://localhost:5001/ROUTE

Remember to change ROUTE to your actual route, e.g. api/type/:name
```

---

## #21 Ask AI to format our response

Copy and paste the entire prompt below into your AI tool:

```text
This is what our API returns:

{
  "half_damage_to": ["rock", "fire", "water", "dragon"],
  "double_damage_from": ["ground", "rock", "water"]
}

Format this in a way that's useful to the user in a Pokemon Battle in plain text.
```
